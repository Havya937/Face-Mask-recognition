The system is implemented using the Python programming language and the OpenCV
library. OpenCV is a popular computer vision library that provides a variety of
functions for image processing and object detection.
The system works as follows:
1. The input image or video is resized to a fixed size.
2. The face detector is used to identify faces in the image or video.
3. For each face detected, the mask classifier is used to classify the face as wearing
or not wearing a mask.
4. The output of the system is a list of faces detected that are not wearing mask
