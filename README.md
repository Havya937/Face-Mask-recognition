# Face-Mask-recognition
This project aimed to develop a real-time face mask detection system using computer vision and deep learning techniques.
ntroduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of face masks in preventing the
spread of respiratory viruses. Face mask detection systems have emerged as a potential tool
for enforcing mask-wearing in public spaces and ensuring public safety. This project aimed to
develop a real-time face mask detection system using computer vision and deep learning
techniques.
Objectives
The primary objectives of this project were to:
1.  Design and implement a face mask detection system using deep learning algorithms.
2.  Achieve high accuracy in detecting individuals wearing and not wearing face masks.
3.  Optimize the system for real-time performance.
4.  Evaluate the system's performance using a comprehensive testing methodology.
System Design:
The face mask detection system consists of two main components: a face detector
and a mask classifier. The face detector is responsible for identifying faces in images
and videos. The mask classifier is responsible for classifying faces as wearing or not
wearing masks.
